      <p>My name is Lucy Bloomfield and I’m a designer that specialises in user experience and strategy. I’ve worked with some cool companies and agencies, of which the full list can be seen below. I love art, food (cooking it mostly), photography and great fiction.</p>
      <p>I also write a lot - you can read my thoughts on basically everything in my journal.</p>

      <p>Myself and my business partner started a cosmetics company when we realised there was a gap in the market for quality skin care that looks beautiful and doesn’t cost a fortune. This project has involved creating and designing a company from scratch, touching on language, marketing, social media, packaging, brand and websites. A work in progress.</p>

      <p class='skills'>Skills required: strategy, marketing, copywriting, packaging design, branding, web design, front-end development</p>

      <h3 class='company'>Security Innovation</h3>
      <p>I was Lead Designer for the TEAM Mentor product team for 15 months, working remotely while traveling. In that time, I wore many hats including visual designer, user experience designer, user interface designer, strategy designer and front-end developer. The project was enormous and involved a complete redesign of a product that was originally created in the 90’s and hadn’t been touched since.</p>

      <p>During this time, I also had the opportunity to work on other projects in the company,
including a client portal that allowed clients to communicate directly with security
engineers in the company. I created a style guide for TEAM Mentor that is now used
as a reference point for all employees when creating content and was the guru for all
things design.</p>

      <p class='skills'>Skills required: user research, wire framing, prototyping, communication (selling concepts to managers), copywriting, visual design, iconography, typography, front-end development</p>

      <br>
      <h3 class='company'>QA</h3>
      <p>I wrote a beginners Ruby on Rails course for QA, the leading tech education company in London. This involved research, planning modules, writing, coding and a small amount of design as well as editing and preparing documents for use by the company.</p>

      <p class='skills'>Skills required: research, wire framing, communication, writing, preparing documents for production, front-end development, back-end development</p>

      <h3 class='company'>JosephMark</h3>
      <p>I worked with JosephMark for an 8 week stint as an intern. My project was a mobile app for a skin care survey run by QUT. This project was started from scratch and involved a lot of user research and wire framing and ending with a complete application that collect data for the university.</p>

      <p class='skills'>Skills required: research, user research, communication (liaising with client), wire framing, prototyping, visual design, iconography, typography, front-end development, back-end development</p>

      <h3 class='company'>ae creative</h3>
      <p>I worked with ae creative back when I was still attending the University of the Sunshine Coast, where Brian Keayes (the founder) was my tutor for my web design class. This opportunity was incredible and I can’t thank Brian enough. I got to work on a lot of different projects involving web design mostly.</p>

      <p>During my career as a designer, I've spent a lot of time working out who I am and how I want to work. Much like a company needs values, so to do individuals and these are the ones I keep returning to and basing my work off:</p>

        <li>Simple is better</li>
