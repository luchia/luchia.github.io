		<h1 class="title">Jekyll FTW</h1>
		
		<p>I haven’t had a website in a long time, partly due to business and partly due to not wanting to be online as much. My previous websites were built with Rails which, while fun to learn and easy to use once created, were cumbersome, heavy and slow-loading. It was also a pain in the ass to maintain. Enter Jekyll.</p>

<p>Given that I no longer want to display a portfolio and need 1) a resume and 2) a place to dump my thoughts, Jekyll was the obvious choice. You can find a multitude of tutorials online for building simple, and not so simple, sites with Jekyll. The power of the internet is mighty and infinite.</p>

<h6>What is Jekyll?</h6>

<p>It’s a basic static site generator which processes a set of files and generates an output suitable for deployment. Jekyll is a Ruby gem so it’s installed through the command line. For the most part, it's similar to writing static HTML templates which, after working in Jade and HAML for so long, wasn't particularly nice to return to. But the convenience is in my ability to maintain it through Markdown and host it via Github pages.</p>

<p>I whipped this version up in my spare time in the last week and am looking forward to refining it over time, while enjoying the ease of maintaining a website that compiles it’s own content and does automatic deploys for me, for once.</p>
