          <p>Quade was the first foster cat that into our home and he was also one of the most difficult. Nobody knew Quade’s full story but we did know that he had been surrendered to a local pound and he was very near to being put to sleep.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/quade/quade-2.jpg" alt="Quade in the beginning - shy, insecure and distrustful" /></p>

<p>Quade was the first animal that I have ever thought could experience the emotion love. After many months of getting him comfortable in our home and with us as his carers, there was a trust there that radiated out of his eyes. He was a lap cat, through and through, and would spend as many hours as he possibly could on my partner’s lap while he was gaming or in my arms while I worked on <a href="http://www.trefiel.com">Trefiel</a>.</p>

<p>Quade taught me compassion for abused beings. It was many months before we were able to love him fully without him flinching or hiding under the couch. He also taught me patience through showing me my tendencies for impatience. Staying present in my dealings with him was difficult a lot of the time, due to outside factors and stress involved in running our business. But ‘stay present’ was a statement I repeated to myself often when sharing our house with him.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/quade/quade-1.jpg" alt="Quade in the end - loving, happy but always a little cautious" /></p>

<p>Most of all, Quade brought warmth into our home. Opening the door to see him waiting for us, having cuddles during the day and sharing the bed with him at night are some of my fondest memories with him. And while he may be rehomed and loving his new family, Quade will always be a reminder to me of the ability that beings outside of humans have lessons to teach too.</p>
