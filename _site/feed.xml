        <title>I'm starting fresh and I'm terrified</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been fascinated by nature and craved time spent in it without always knowing why. As I’ve grown older and somewhat wiser, I understand that as a human, it’s one of my core needs to feel a part of something bigger. Nature often gives me that sensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve been watching more and more documentaries on climate change and the consequences of global warming. I’ve wanted to do something, anything, to try to alleviate the issue or at least bring awareness to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I didn’t have time… I was running an eCommerce business. When I stepped back from running Trefiel, I I didn’t have the knowledge to get started and felt I had to learn more before I could act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve realise in the last few days that I’m plain terrified to get stuck into climate change because I’m not a physicist, scientist or academic in any shape or form. I’m not qualified to speak about it nor do I have the understanding of how huge the problem is. I have no prior experience aside from running a small eCommerce business and being somewhat acceptable at marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know the first thing about changing the world.But I do know this -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to. My head has been filled with anxiety about this issue and my lack of action has caused immeasurable guilt in the last 6 months. I have not helped educate nor improve the state of the world, I have only taken from it. That has to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what the next 12 months will look like, let alone the next 12 days… but I have a plan. I’m moving to Berlin for one month in a few days and I will be taking every measure I can to meet the type of people I need to meet in order to do something in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know nothing about this industry nor what it will take to change the world. I want to make a difference though and I will find an idea, a Co-Founder or a company to put my skills, enthusiasm and experience to work for.&lt;/p&gt;
