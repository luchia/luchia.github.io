          <p>I was coming home on the tram from a meet up the other day. This in itself isn’t very exciting but I do enjoy being in a city where there are so many types of people around. People-watching is both constructive and meditative, especially if approached from a non-judgemental aspect (FYI, it’s not people-watching if you’re making criticisms, it’s being a jerk).</p>

<p>In particular, I was watching a girl, over her shoulder, write a text on her phone. I know this is terrible and I’m a snoop, but I couldn’t help it. What she was doing was fascinating. You see, she really liked Will and even though they weren’t (at that moment) talking about their feelings, I could tell.</p>

<p>I watched this girl rewrite her message fives times before it was acceptable to send. The first time she admitted to eating leftovers out of the fridge, but that was deleted. The second time she went the mum route and told him she should eat breakfast, but that was also deleted. The final message was a suggestion for him to try the olive sourdough/spinach/egg/tomato/bocconcini/olive oil/salt/pepper combo because it would change his life.</p>

<p>I can’t comment on the last version of the text message (that breakfast sounds amazing to me), but I found it exhilarating to watch as this girl edited away her responses until it was perfect. A perfect response so that she seemed perfect. The connotations I took from that message was that she eats well, she cooks and she’s healthy and that’s probably what Will took from it too. But I got to see the previous versions.</p>

<p>I know that she’s just like any person, who goes the easiest route at breakfast time and reaches for leftovers. I know she’s nervous and she likes Will a lot, but she doesn’t want to come across as too clingy. I know she’s scared that the first version of herself isn’t enough and she needs to provide an edited response. Most of all, I know she desperately wants to be loved because I watched her check her messages 10 times, waiting for his response.</p>

<p>Appearances aren’t everything and the way people choose to portray themselves is often an edited response, changed by the pressure of wanting to fit in and be liked. I know that I did this a lot before I went traveling and still occasionally do, but the older I get the more I find that being myself is far more fun than editing myself.</p>

<p>NB: I didn’t even edit this post. First version FTW.</p>
