title: What's it's like to work at Security Innovation

For the last three to four months, I've spoken at quite a few conferences about working remotely. In Australia, this concept hasn't really come into play that much yet and I think one of the main reasons for this is that we don't have a large start up scene here and a lot of the companies designers and developers work for are brick and mortar types (ie. very old-fashioned).

I've really enjoyed sharing what working remotely is, how good it is and how to do it efficiently which is something I know a lot about thanks to the team at [Security Innovation](http://www.securityinnovation.com). As I wrapped up my last talk on working remotely at Decompress, Melbourne, I thought I'd do a summary post of what it's like to work remotely and why I love working for SI so much.

### What is working remotely?

It's when you complete you work in a place other than your employees office. It can be working from home, from a co-working space or while travelling - as I did for the last 12 months. It's becoming a more and more viable solution to the productive worker conundrum, giving freedom and responsibility to the employee while cutting down costs and improving output for the employer.

### How do I become a remote worker?

If you’re a freelancer, then you can arrange a remote working situation quite easily by re-adjusting your clients and the way you work. If you’re employed, then it’ll be a little different.

Firstly, you should concentrate on improving your productivity and performance at work. This can include 4HWW principles such as having an auto-responder on emails defining response times, skipping meetings and using your most productive parts of the day to get large tasks done. Once you’ve increased productivity and it’s been noticed, suggest to your employer that you’d like to try a trial period where you work one day a week from home. Save a little bit of productivity for when you go home - that is, work better at home - and continue to be productive in the office. The rest is negotiating.

A lot of people ask me about how to become a remote worker and the easy answer is to ask. The worst thing your employer can say to you is no. If you pitch it right and have proven that you can do your work and do it well, the whole telecommuting concept is not a strange or uncommon request.

### Pros and Cons

I’m going to be completely honest about what it’s like to work remotely. The cons are:

* Communication is hard (no sharing paper sketches, no brainstorming together)
* Timezone differences
* Company culture is hard to maintain because there’s no water cooler to meet at
* Workaholicism
* It can be lonely working from home
* Travelling and finding good internet can be difficult depending on where you are

The positives of working remotely:

* You have fantastic work life (balance, picking hours, appointments)
* Costs are lower
* Getting away from distractions (but it’s still easy to procrastinate)
* Wearing your pyjamas to work has its bonuses
* Increased productivity (10-20% more productive)

Working remotely is not just beneficial for employees though. From a company perspective, the pros are:

* Increased productivity, remote workers log more hours than their office-based colleagues (Gallup’s State of American Workplace)
* You have access to more talent, better talent and can find it at a faster rate
* Costs dramatically reduced
* Respond to ‘oh shit’ moments quicker

And the cons:

* It’s hard to find people who are good at working remotely
* Company culture isn’t built naturally (you’ve got to work for it)

### Day-to-day routine

Currently, I only work four days a week, which for me, is the perfect balance between work and play. This is one of the things I enjoy most about working remotely - I can work when I feel like it. My average day will look something like this-

* 5am - Wake up + coffee
* 5.10am - Laptop on, headphones in
* 8am - Meeting
* 9am - Misc
* 10am - Work
* 2pm - Misc
* 4pm - Work
* 5pm - Bedtime - Misc

As you can see, I’ve got a time throughout my day to step away from my work and reset.  Some days I’ll go to the gym twice, read, go see friends, nap, design for side projects, draw, photograph things… whatever I feel like doing.  Some days I work straight through from 5am until 1pm so I have the afternoon and night free.  As long as the work is done, the hours that I work can be spread throughout my day however I like.

### Software

It’s thanks to technology that I’m able to work the way I do. Most remote workers have a basic set up that’s fairly similar, so I won’t spend too long on this topic.

* Skype (meetings)
* Wunderlist (personal task manager)
* Github (Git) (work task manager)
* Gmail (communication)
* Google Calendar (meetings)
* Join.me (screen sharing)
* Slack (collaboration, company culture)

This set up is not without it’s faults. For example, we could use:

* Trello (team task manager)
* Google Hangouts (combined meetings, screen sharing, collaboration, company culture)

On the development team, we leverage Github for team collaboration. We have a team of developers working on this project around the clock so it’s really important that our repos are up-to-date.  We have a repo for the project and within that repo we have a number of different branches.The first branch is master and is the source code that the project is deployed from. The second branch is Dev, which is the branch all team members eventually merge their own separate branches onto.

We then have all of our own separate branches to work on individually. This means that no ones code gets left behind on merges or disappears due to other team members pushing or pulling code. The final type of branch we have relates to specific issues on Github which require more than one team member to work on it. By doing this, we move the code to a place that is easily shared between team members and can be worked on without affecting the original code.

We also have a set up which has automatic testing. As soon as a push is made to Github, our tests are running on Travis. This allows us to see immediately if our changes have broken tests and if they have, we write new tests to cover them. We’ve managed to cover everything, right down to CSS styles, and currently have a 98% code coverage.

### Time Management

It’s easy to think that because you’re working from home, it’ll be easier to get distracted and you’ll get less work done. I also thought the same thing but once you’re in the situation and the work *has* to be done, you do it. Something that I’ve noticed is that I procrastinate more in the office than I do at home.  I used to work in the law industry and most of my day was spent responding to emails and googling, which are essentially the work-force’s approved form of procrastination.

I have a couple of small things that really help improve my productivity:

* I use page blockers on my browser so that I cannot get distracted. (Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, Gmail, Twitter)
* I have a routine that I stick to most days which keeps me on track.
* I think it’s important to learn how to properly priorities your work - what needs to be done now, what needs to be done today and what should be done tomorrow.
* It’s been said many times, but Social Media can be one of the biggest distractions we have. I limit my time on social media ruthlessly and am much happier and more productive for it.

### Work-Life Balance

As much as we have creative jobs and projects to work on, it’s still important to make time to work on things outside of the scope of your job. Whether this is part of an 80/20 rule with the company you work for or you spend your weekends writing a novel, having creative side projects that are started to fuel your passion will ensure that your work doesn’t become unenjoyable. There’s always going to be more work to do and emails to read, so for the sake of your sanity take your leisure time as seriously as you do your work time.

The other thing that I highly recommend for work-life balance and overall happiness is travel. Not only will you be exposed to new cultures and foods, you’ll meet people that you wouldn’t have otherwise. I speak from experience when I say this - my two biggest job offers last year were chance occurrences where I just happened to be in the right place, at the time. Travel is also a great way to balance your day because you work for part of the day and spend the rest exploring a new city or meeting new people.

Finally, whenever you have the chance - disconnect from the world. Switch off your computer, your phone, everything. Go sit outside in the park and watch the clouds float by. Meditate and think about the something outside of your small circle - for me, that’s space - and remind yourself that no matter what’s happening in your life, it too will pass.
