Spring is my favourite time of the year. The sun starts to burn a little, the days warm up yet the nights are still cool. I sometimes still get a rainy day to lay in bed on the weekends (or week days), but there’s also the beautiful clear days that should only be spent racing through the mountains on a motorbike.

Although I’ve been writing regularly for myself, I haven’t touched this blog in months, let alone had the desire to craft a well-written post. Although there have been posts created in 2015, reading them back I realise they lack the special spark that makes this corner of the internet, mine. 

So where did Lucy go? Simply put, I was too busy living my life to write about and document it. This year I’ve spoken at multiple conferences, I lived in the Middle East (amazing place, would go back there in a heartbeat), learnt to ride a motorbike, learnt how to pole dance, had surgery, learnt how to cook (properly) and moved to a new city. I’ve explored my identity and the ways in which I express myself, my communication channels, my relationships and my flaws. I’ve even managed, although I still struggle with it, to remove myself entirely from social media, excluding business accounts.

Part of my not wanting to write for this blog has been paired with my desire to remove myself from social media. I didn’t want to share my posts on platforms, receive gratification by the various notification systems or receive congratulations from friends and family. I didn’t want to feel as if this blog was for anyone else but myself, and I think given my current metrics (a big 0 visitors for the last however many months), this is now possible.

I’ll be writing from now on about the things which interest me because they are many and varied. I want to write more about the cities I visit while traveling and the people I meet every day. I want to write and learn through my social experiments and share my thoughts on the books I’m reading. Mostly, I want to use this as a brain dump, a collection of thoughts and feelings, as a reminder of how quickly things can change.

I call this spring chaos because I feel like the whole concept of ‘spring cleaning’ and the end of the year drives people to do wild things - review their life, say things that haven’t been said, finish half-completed things and make big changes. In that respect, I’m not all that unusual.
