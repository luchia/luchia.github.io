There’s already a vast collection of articles written about successful people and their morning habits, but I’m not a celebrity entrepreneur and no one knows what I do every morning.

In the last 6 months, I’ve been using myself as a bit of guinea pig and experimenting with different actions and noticing the effects they have on me. At this stage, I feel like I’ve really nailed my morning routine and feel comfortable with the feeling of accomplishment it gives me and also the state of mind it leaves me in to finish my day. I thought it could be interesting to share what I do and potentially open up some discussion in regards to ways I could improve my day.

## Make the bed

If I only do one thing a day, it’s got to be this. Leaving the house knowing this is done makes me feel like I’ve done the smallest thing right, even if everything else goes wrong. I’ve noticed if I do this, I notice other small things that go right and become more appreciative of those. More appreciation = greater happiness.

## Getting up early

It’s been a drag doing this recently, especially when I spend the night with my partner talking strategy for Trefiel, but without a doubt this is a huge contributor to how I feel about my day and how much I get done. When I’m up early, the whole day lies ahead of me - glittering and full of possibility. I get the quiet of the mornings, where no one is awake and there are no interruptions. I also get an exceptionally good nights sleep when i stay in routine and wake up early every day.

## Exercise

The prime time to do cardio. I’m trying a split at the moment that requires 2 workouts a day, but for only 20 minutes each - the goal being to train with extremely high intensity in two short bursts. I can definitely attest to the success I’m having with this at the moment as I’m 21% body fat and leaner than I’ve ever been. Getting a dose of endorphins before I sit down to work also helps with my concentration and ability to retain information. I’ve noticed that if I listen to podcasts or University material while I exercise, I have higher retention of the information.

## Fasting

This is something I’ve been playing with consistently for about a month now, although I have done it previously. Fasting is a god-send when you’re dropping weight. For one thing, you only have a short period of time that’s open for eating, which means fitting in the days calories becomes a much more difficult thing. Instead of spreading my calories over an entire day (3 meals plus snacking), I fit it into an 8 hour window that usually consists of 2 meals plus minimal snacking.

Another thing is the concentration gained from not thinking about food constantly. I know that I can’t be the only one that struggles with this. Once I start eating, I think about my next meal constantly and am dealing with hungry pains all day. Making this phase shorter has lessened it’s impact on my life but also given me extreme clarity.

## Lemon Water

This one is related to fasting. I enjoy the way this beverage makes me feel in the mornings while I’m waiting for my fasting period to end. A lot of people like tea and coffee while fasting because it does quell hunger pains, but I’m steering clear of caffeine at the moment (another thing that I think helps with concentration) and for me this is just as good. It’s 100x better with coconut oil in it, but isn’t everything?

*****

Hopefully this gives people some ideas about habits that actually work to improve focus and accomplishments achieved. I’d be interested to hear if anyone has any suggestions about other things I could try to improve my morning rituals further.
